# AirBnB Clone Project

## üè† Overview

This project is a **clone of the AirBnB web application**, developed as part of the **ALX Software Engineering program**. The objective is to build a **full-stack web application** from scratch, simulating key features of the real AirBnB platform.

It follows a modular, scalable architecture and progresses in stages‚Äîfrom console-based data manipulation to a fully functional dynamic website, including deployment.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Build a powerful and flexible **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** for object manipulation.
- Implement **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) using Python.
- Handle **data persistence** using both file-based storage (`.json`) and relational databases (`MySQL`).
- Develop a **web interface** using HTML/CSS and the **Flask** framework.
- Practice **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** with Python‚Äôs `unittest` module.
- Apply software engineering best practices: code style, documentation, version control, and deployment.
